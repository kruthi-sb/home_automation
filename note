#Just a quick note.

#If you want to run this program ALL THE TIME (which I'm assuming you do), even when you're not sitting at the CLI, DO THIS:

#Install tmux. This is a session multiplexer...basically you can have multiple SSH sessions in one window.

#COMMAND: 

sudo apt install tmux

#This will open a new terminal which will allow you to run the script. 

sudo python halloween/halloween.py

#Close your SSH client and you're done!!
